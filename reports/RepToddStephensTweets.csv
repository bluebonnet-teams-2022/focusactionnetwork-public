318,https://twitter.com/RepToddStephens/status/855136593237168130,@kbucklen Right then we did an amendment this yr that dramatically reduced the estimates yet DOC says it will still cost the same as last year's bill.
319,https://twitter.com/RepToddStephens/status/855126108072804358,@kbucklen Funny how the DOC cost number didn't change despite dramatic reductions in the estimates for the prison pop.
320,https://twitter.com/RepToddStephens/status/855120195521830913,@kbucklen Btw - you may want to check the fiscal impact since we amended the bill.The $85m you cite is not correct.  Wouldn't say you were lying tho.

338,https://twitter.com/RepToddStephens/status/823020962740371456,@kbucklen Then you support reinstating the death penalty right? After all it eliminates recidivism concerns.
339,https://twitter.com/RepToddStephens/status/823020572896534529,@kbucklen The criminologist in the article I sent you agrees - after the higher incarceration rates of course.
340,https://twitter.com/RepToddStephens/status/823020236656017408,@kbucklen I'm well aware. Got the numbers minus drug crimes? Sex crimes? I prosecuted plenty of older adults for those.

342,https://twitter.com/RepToddStephens/status/823018266318827520,@kbucklen So we should just leave the drug dealer there???
343,https://twitter.com/RepToddStephens/status/823018184383090689,@kbucklen Why has the violent crime rate in PA dropped consistently since the early to mid 90's?
344,https://twitter.com/RepToddStephens/status/823017986810413056,@kbucklen Oh so you only allow early release for criminals over what age? 35? 45? 55?
345,https://twitter.com/RepToddStephens/status/823017784472961025,@kbucklen What about punishment and incapacitation?
346,https://twitter.com/RepToddStephens/status/823015040752173056,@kbucklen The issue isn't shutting down parole. It's your efforts to move more people from prison to parole and the risk to public safety.
347,https://twitter.com/RepToddStephens/status/823013112035082240,@kbucklen According to this 1 reasons the crime rate in 2012 was the lowest in decades is bc of longer incar rates. https://t.co/6C5kgJUiee
348,https://twitter.com/RepToddStephens/status/823011505604034560,@kbucklen A parolee just raped and/or killed 7 women. Before we let more people out let's figure out how to prevent that from happening.
349,https://twitter.com/RepToddStephens/status/823010001765756930,@kbucklen Right. It's been dropping while we had the tougher penalties in place. Exactly why they need to be reinstated.
350,https://twitter.com/RepToddStephens/status/823006907531149312,"@kbucklen I quoted the article. Also, more parolees at same recidivism rate = more crimes committed."
