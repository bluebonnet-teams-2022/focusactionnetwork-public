https://twitter.com/JonDBrien1/status/1468973503021940746,@ThomasJDubois 4/ I led the Women’s Shelter Beautification Project for the Rotary Club and transformed the living space at the shelter for the residents and kids with over 15 yards of crushed stone and 13 yards of loom and created garden space. Where were you?
https://twitter.com/JonDBrien1/status/1468973094798704641,"@ThomasJDubois 3/ As part of the Rotary Club we have opened Just For You clothing closet for homeless, foster and disadvantaged kids 0-17.  The amount of work to do this is immeasurable. We have clothed over 150 children after acquiring, laundering and sorting tons of clothes. Where were you?"
https://twitter.com/JonDBrien1/status/1468972570577805321,"@ThomasJDubois 2/ I work at the All Saints Food Pantry feeding the poor and homeless of our city and have done so for almost 2 years. When not providing frozen meats and essentials, we unload usually 3-5 tons of food from the RI Foodbank.  Strange, haven’t seen you there helping."

https://twitter.com/JonDBrien1/status/1468778250432299013,@JacobBrierBTC @WoonyWizard @projo @esanzi It’s not transphobic to want your girls to compete against biological girls.
